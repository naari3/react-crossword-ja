To make crosswords as easy to create as possible, with the least amount of extraneous and boilerplate typing, the clue/answer format is structured as a set of nested objects:

```javascript static
{
  across: {
    1: {
      clue: 'one plus one',
      answer: 'TWO',
      row: 0,
      col: 0,
    },
  },
  down: {
    2: {
      clue: 'three minus two',
      answer: 'ONE',
      row: 0,
      col: 2,
    },
  },
}
```

At the top level, the `across` and `down` properties group together the clues/answers for their respective directions. Each of those objects is a map, keyed by the answer number rather than an array. (This is done so that the creator has control over the numbering/labelling of the clues/answers.) Each item contains a `clue` and `answer` property, as well as `row` and `col` for the starting position.

```jsx
import Crossword from '@naari3/react-crossword-ja';

const data = {
  across: {
    1: {
      clue: 'one plus one',
      answer: 'TWO',
      row: 0,
      col: 0,
    },
  },
  down: {
    2: {
      clue: 'three minus two',
      answer: 'ONE',
      row: 0,
      col: 2,
    },
  },
};

<div style={{ width: '25em', display: 'flex' }}>
  <Crossword data={data} />
</div>;
```

The `CrosswordProvider` component (automatically used by `Crossword`) calculates the needed grid size from the data itself, so you don't need to pass an overall size to the component.
